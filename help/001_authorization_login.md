## Authorization and login

Launch Apero and enter your pnut.io login and password in the login window:

![login](https://monosnap.com/file/R5geAsQwvOK3hhQXjRLb4wan9AzpzB.png)

If you have clicked on a link before entering your credentials, just click on the "GO TO LOGIN PAGE" button.

You may also want to click on the "OPEN IN BROWSER" button if you want to use a password manager such as 1Password.

If this is your first connection to pnut.io, or if you reconnect after having changed the capabilities of your account, you will have to confirm the usage of "scopes" such as posts, messages, etc. We recommend to accept what is presented, otherwise features could be limited.

Once you have entered your username and login, and accepted the terms if needed, pnut.io will safely send back an authorization token to Apero, which will close the login window then open its main window.

If you're asked by macOS to access the Keychain with such dialog box, please accept:

![keychain](https://monosnap.com/file/hdPgedHaySFanIJRrIII5DiFTBpgkX.png)

this is what will enable autologin for the next launches.

Then the default stream, Global, starts downloading immediately:

Apero has safely saved your authorization token in the macOS Keychain and will automatically use it from now on when you launch the app. This means you won't have to login each time you launch Apero.

If you want to switch to another user, select "Logout" in the "Main" menu: the user token will be erased and the authorization window will show up again.
