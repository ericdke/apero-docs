## Navigation

The three icons in the window top bar represent: the Global stream, the Home stream, and the Mentions stream.

Once a stream is selected, its content refreshes automatically, and the other streams are paused.

See the Preferences if you want to change the speed of polling for new content.

## Global

The "Global" stream shows all public posts made by all normal users.

## Home

The "Home" stream shows all public posts made by users you follow.

If you have unchecked "Include directed posts" in Preferences, replies by users you follow to users you don't follow will not be displayed.

## Mentions

The "Mentions" stream only shows posts that contain a mention of your username.
