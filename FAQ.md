Apero is a macOS client for the [pnut.io](https://pnut.io) network (compatible 10.11+, 10.12+ recommended). 

*You must have a pnut.io account in order to use Apero.*

Apero is available exclusively [on the Mac App Store.](https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=1219902108&mt=12)

Pnut.io is a free, but invite-only, short-messaging social network.

All pnut.io users are able to send invitations. You may also get one from pnut.io.

From [the site](https://pnut.io):

> Our community network is small and sustainable. We are tied closely to our users and developers through their donations and optional pay-what-you-want features. When you invite someone, they are associated with you in the user tree. The API encourages a high level of transparency and control. You will need a third-party app to do even the simplest things, but there are plenty of options; from Android and iOS to command line and Blackberry.

...and macOS with Apero!

What does "Apero" mean, by the way? Is it like "apÃ©ro" in French? Or maybe "app hero"? Ah, "happy row"? Mm, "opera" pronounced by a peanut? Go figure... and go "Apero"!Â ðŸ˜‰

## Authorization and login

Authorize Apero to access your pnut.io account:

- launch Apero, enter your pnut.io login and password, confirm usage of listed features, then pnut.io will safely send back an authorization token to Apero
- Apero will then safely save this token in the macOS Keychain for future usage, then will use it to log you in the pnut network
- successive launches of Apero will automatically log you again in the same account, unless you log out before quitting the app

New post: use "apero://post=your text" to open a new post window prefilled with text. Example in the terminal with the "open" command: 

    $ open "apero://post=Hello from Apero"

    $ open "apero://message:@ericd=Hello from Apero"

*Tip: you can then send the post/message with CMD+ENTER or cancel with ESC.*

## Preferences

### Themes

You can modify Apero's colors.

To achieve this, you may "just" change the colors, or you may load/create a theme.

"Just" changing colors takes effect immediately but you have to click "Just save current colors" in order to persist the changes between launches.

You can otherwise save the set of colors as a theme, giving it a title: it will be added to the list of available themes, and recalled at each launch.

If you modify a theme, you can "just save the current colors" or decide to save as a new theme after the changes.

There's also a set of default themes to choose from.

### Dark mode

When this option is on, Apero uses dark windows. When this option is off (default), Apero uses white windows. Changing mode relaunches the application.

### Fonts

Available fonts are curated to be compatible with Apero and their number is very limited on purpose.

### Monitor system changes

When this option is on (default), Apero will comply to system-wide changes regarding the Dark Mode setting. These changes can be caused by macOS or by applications such as "F.lux".

### Enable animations

When this option is off, Apero will minimize its use of animations (for now, only targets the transition animation between streams).

### Highlight posts mentioning you

When this option is on, posts in Global or in Home are highlighted if they contain a mention of your username.

### Compact channels list

When this option is on, the channels list do not show any details such as the list of users and the last message.

### Polling indicator is visible

When this option is on, every poll for new posts or messages displays an indeterminate circular progress indicator at the top of the window. When this option is off, nothing in the user interface indicates that polls are occuring.

### Timeline sticks to top

When this option is on (default, recommended), the timeline always sticks to the top of the window if you're already there, and continues to download new posts automatically.

When this option is off, the timeline doesn't stick to top at all and instead shows an icon when new posts are available - then stops downloading new posts if you don't scroll to top. It starts downloading again once you are at the top.

### Localized date in timeline

When this option is on, the date and time are displayed using Apero's user's locale and timezone. When this option is off, the date and time are displayed using the original poster's timezone and are not localized.

### Show verified icon

When this option is on, an icon is displayed in timelines next to the avatar of "verified" users. (This icon is also always visible in the Profile window).

### Open patter.chat links in Apero

When this option is on, clicking on a "patter.chat" link in Apero will try to open the channel in Apero itself. When this option is off, clicking on a "patter.chat" link in Apero will open the link in a browser.

### Open posts.pnut.io links in Apero

When this option is on, clicking on a "posts.pnut.io" link in Apero will try to open the post in Apero itself. When this option is off, Apero will open the link in a browser.

### Include directed posts

When this option is on, the Home timeline includes all posts from the users you follow, including the posts directed to users you don't follow.

### Manual post/message selection 

When the option is on (default: off), the selected post/message is visible and these keyboard shorcuts are available:

    - for posts:

    	p = profile
    	r = reply
    	o = open image (if any)
    	SHIFT + o = repost
    	s = search user's posts
    	SHIFT + s = star (bookmark) post
    	t = thread (if any)
    	SHIFT + t = translate
    	e = edit (if applicable)
    	SHIFT + d = delete (if applicable)
    	h = hide
    	c = copy content
    	a = view the post's actions (if any)

    - for messages: 

    	p = profile
		r = reply
		o = open image (if any)
		s = search messages in channel
		t = thread (if any)
		SHIFT + t = translate
		SHIFT + d = delete (if applicable)
		h = hide
		c = copy content

### Hide NSFW posts

When this option is on, posts tagged with "#NSFW" or programmatically marked as NSFW will not be visible in the timeline.

### Automatically save draft

When this option is on, canceling a new post, message, or a reply to a post or message you're writing persistently saves its content. This content is then automatically loaded back when you make the same action again. Limited to 10 items.

### Clear saved drafts

Clears all drafts from memory and from disk. The action is immediate.

### Memory cache limit

Maximum cost in RAM of the images/gif cache system. The unit is in Megapixels. Depending of the images compression ratio and bit depth, the default cost of 500MP is usually around 250MB of jpg/png/gif cache in RAM. When the limit is hit, the biggest images in the cache are purged to let room for the new ones. Minimum: 250. No maximum - but more than 2000 would probably be useless.

### Memory cache purge

Number of days (running time) between the images/gif memory cache cleaning cycles. Note that changing this option, even to set it again to the same value, automatically triggers the memory cache cleaning procedure.

### Disk cache purge

Number of days (calendar time) between the images/gif disk cache cleaning cycle. Note that changing this option, even to set it again to the same value, automatically triggers the disk cache cleaning of the expired items.

### Cursor position when replying

When replying to a post or a message and there's several mentions, Apero can insert the text cursor just after the leading mention, or after all the mentions.

### Leading and trailing swipe actions

You can assign the actions availables in the context menus to swipe actions on posts and messages: copy, hide, reply, translate, interactions.

### Translation engine

Apero can use Google Translate or Yandex Translate to translate posts and messages.

Google Translate has excellent performances, but has limitations: it cannot detect non-latin languages when doing in-app translation (it works only with translation in browser, the languages have to be specified for in-app), and the total number of languages available is rather small.

Yandex Translate has a great number of languages available and does detect non-latin languages rather well, but the combinations of source-target translations is limited: the presence of language A and language B in the list does not guarantee that Yandex will be able to translate from A to B.

When a language is selected but the translate engine cannot use it, Apero will default to "Automatic" (detection) for source, and English for target.

Also keep in mind that sometimes the @mentions, #tags and links in the text can confuse the language detector. If there's an error or results make no sense, try switching automatic/manual or using the other engine.

### Translation happens in...

Translation can happen in Apero or in browser. When happening "in Apero", the current text displayed for the post or message is replaced by its translation (right-click or swipe once again to show back the original post). But if there's an error or the service is not available, Apero will instead open the translation in a browser.

### Translation languages

The "Follow preferences" setting tells Apero that you want to translate directly using the source and target settings, without having to choose each time in a dialog box. Whereas the "Always ask" setting tells Apero that you always want to choose languages manually before translating.

### Translation source

The "Automatic" setting means that the translation engine will try to autodetect the source language. You may otherwise choose one of the listed languages as the default.

### Translation target

The language the post or message will be translated to.

## Support

- For an issue about Apero the application itself, contact apero@aya.io
- For an issue about the pnut.io network or a user, contact support@pnut.io
- The pnut.io [Terms of Service](https://pnut.io/docs/tos) and [Privacy Policy](https://pnut.io/docs/privacy) apply when using Apero. Do not post inappropriate content or behave in inappropriate ways. Your account may be suspended by pnut.io without warning if deemed a threat to others or to the service's maintenance and upkeep. 
- If you want to report a specific user, send an email to support@pnut.io. In Apero, you can yourself filter objectionable content and users with the hide, mute and block features, see the Objectionable Content chapter on this page.

## Features and availability
 
Apero does not guarantee uptime or delivery of the pnut.io services, it is only an independent client application. If pnut.io doesn't work for any reason, then Apero doesn't work, as one would expect. In this sense, buying Apero does not guarantee any period of functioning time for the application.

## Privacy

Apero does not collect user information in any way. Users list such as those used for username autocompletion are only populated while the application is running, live, and do not persist into any form of storage, neither while the application is running nor after it's been quit.

## Objectionable Content

Apero users have four possible actions against objectionable content.

Level 1 - Swipe towards left, or right-click, to quickly hide the post/message. This is temporary and lasts only until the next time the current content is reloaded, be it automatically or manually. This is a simple convenience intended to quickly hide the objectionable content before deciding upon further possible action.

Level 2 - Click the Mute button in a user profile: if you mute a user, you won't see their posts anymore. This works like a filter, managed on API side by pnut.io. The effects are immediate and stay active forever unless you click the Unmute button.

Level 3 - Click the Block button in a user profile: if you block a user, they will be automatically muted (as in level 2), they will also be unfollowed, then it limits their account: they will automatically unfollow you, and they won't be able to follow you again, to message you or to do any other action related to your account anymore. This is also managed on API side by pnut.io. The effects are immediate and the limits stay active forever unless you click the Unblock button.

Level 4 - Report: block the user, then send an email to support@pnut.io asking for moderation (give user ids, posts numbers, details about issue).
